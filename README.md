# credstream - "stream beyond boundaries"

With the use of current technologies, it is now possible to create and distribute illegal copy of a digital video in public domains. Due to piracy, the entertainment business loses over a billion dollars annually.

credstream is a more robust Over-The-Top software product developed in flutter, python, django technologies making use of visible and invisible watermarking strategies for digital videos streamed. Various OTT services presently employ various security methods to prevent video screen recording and downloading. In the event of screen recording, the attacker will only see a dark display. Further the streamed data is stored in the user device's cache in an encrypted format, which in itself is a significant vulnerability and is often exploited by video pirates.  

credstream offers a more robust way to watermark the video with information identifying the user who requested the video and stream that watermarked video in order to prevent piracy through downloading. Therefore, if this video is pirated, the watermark can be extracted to identify the source of the theft.
